In the class, we have learned simple join. Sometimes, for some of the rows you are joining, you may not be able to find a matching records in another table. In that case, you still want to keep the records from one table after JOIN. In this lab-problem set, we will learn how to do that. 

The following figure shows different types of joins, and how to run the query for each type.

## Curtailed FacebookDB

```{r, eval = F}
library(DBI)
# create database: this will create a file in our hard drive
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "~/Data/my472/facebook-db-mini.sqlite")
# reading the first file
congress <- read.csv("~/Data/my472/congress-facebook-2017.csv",
	stringsAsFactors=F)

set.seed(20181128)
congress <- congress[sample(nrow(congress), 100), ]
# adding first table: user-level data
dbWriteTable(db, "congress", congress)
# testing that it works with a simple query
dbListFields(db, "congress")
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT * FROM congress LIMIT 5')
```


```{r, eval = F}

fls <- list.files("~/Data/my472/posts", full.names=TRUE)
set.seed(20181128)

for (f in fls){
  
  message(f)
  # read file into memory
  fb <- read.csv(f, stringsAsFactors=F)
  fb <- fb[sample(nrow(fb), size = nrow(fb)/20), ]
  
  # adding to table in SQL database
  dbWriteTable(db, "posts", fb, append=TRUE)
  
}
# testing that it works
dbListFields(db, "posts")
dbGetQuery(db, 'SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT 5')
# what if we make a mistake and want to remove the table?
# dbRemoveTable(db, "posts")
# and we close the connection for now
dbDisconnect(db)

```

## Questions

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(tidyverse)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "~/Data/my472/facebook-db-mini.sqlite")
```

1. How many rows in each table
```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts")

dbGetQuery(db, 
"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM congress")
```

2. How many rows by joining posts with congress?

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts AS p
JOIN congress AS c
ON c.screen_name = p.screen_name
")

```

3. How many rows by left-joining posts with congress?

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts AS p
LEFT JOIN congress AS c
ON c.screen_name = p.screen_name
")

```


4. What happens if you try right join?
```{r}
msg <- try(
dbGetQuery(db, 
"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts AS p
RIGHT JOIN congress AS c
ON c.screen_name = p.screen_name
"))
message(msg)
```

5. Try left outer join with `IS NULL` condition
```{r}

dbGetQuery(db, 
"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts AS p
LEFT JOIN congress AS c
ON c.screen_name = p.screen_name
WHERE c.bioid IS NULL
")
```


```{R}
dbDisconnect(db)
```

## Subquery


In SQL, you can run a nested query where you use a result from the first query as a condition for the second query. Where we find a top 3 most frequent posters in the congress, and then get all messages from them. 

```{r}
#connect to the full db
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "~/Data/my472/facebook-db.sqlite")
```

1. What are the screen names of the top 3 posters?

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
"SELECT screen_name, COUNT(*) AS post_count
FROM posts
GROUP BY screen_name
ORDER BY post_count DESC
LIMIT 3
")

dbGetQuery(db, 
"SELECT screen_name
FROM posts
GROUP BY screen_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 3
")

```

2. (Without subquery) how to get the posts from these congress members?

```{r}
library(DT)
dbGetQuery(db, 
"SELECT *
FROM posts
WHERE screen_name IN ('CongressmanNadler', 'HurdOnTheHill', 'RepMikeThompson')
") %>% 
  datatable()

```

3. Now, instead of hardcoding the screen_names in the conditional statement, use the query results in #1 as the subquery. 


```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, 
"SELECT *
FROM posts
WHERE screen_name IN (SELECT screen_name
    FROM posts
    GROUP BY screen_name
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 3)
") %>% 
  datatable()

```
